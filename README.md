# Design Patterns Labs

This are my laboratories from the Design Patterns course at TUM(Technical University of Moldova).

Topics: 
- SOLID Principles,
- Creational Design Patterns(Builder Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Prototype Pattern),
- Structural Design Patterns(Adapter Pattern, Facade Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Composite Pattern)
- Behavioral Design Patterns(Observer Pattern, Command Pattern, Strategy Pattern)

The Behavioral DPs we're implemented in a separate repo due to some conflitcs. Here is the [Link to the repo](https://github.com/haritondan/TMPS_LABS2/tree/main)
